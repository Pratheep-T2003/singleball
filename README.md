Ball Animation
Overview
The Ball Animation project is a simple web application that creates a bouncing ball effect on the screen. The ball moves diagonally across the viewport, bouncing off the edges of the screen. This project demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation and animation.

Features
Bouncing Ball Animation: The ball moves smoothly across the screen and bounces off the edges.
Responsive Design: The ball's movement is based on percentage values, making it adaptable to different screen sizes.
Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A modern web browser to run the application.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Open the HTML File
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Usage
Simply open the HTML file in a web browser to see the ball animation in action. The ball will start moving automatically without any user interaction.
Code Structure
HTML: Contains the structure of the webpage, including the ball element.
CSS: Styles for the ball, including its size, shape, and initial position.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for moving the ball and detecting collisions with the edges of the viewport.
Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a brief look at the JavaScript code that controls the ball's movement:

var position = 0;
var velocity = 3;
var moveleft = 2;

function movingBall() {
    position += moveleft * velocity;
    var ball = document.getElementById("ball");
    if (position >= 85 || position <= 3) {
        moveleft *= -1;
    }
    ball.style.top = position + '%';
    ball.style.left = position + '%';
}

setInterval(movingBall, 100);
